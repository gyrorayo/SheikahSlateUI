# KernelSU/APatch/Magisk module for replacing some SystemUI sounds/elements.

## Original: Havoc-LockUnlock-sounds - https://github.com/Aritzherrero4/Havoc-LockUnlock-sounds

### Changes: | charging.ogg | disconnect.ogg | Effect_Tick.ogg (tap sounds) | Lock.ogg | LowBattery.ogg | Unlock.ogg

#### TODO: | Delete/uninstall app sounds | DND off sound | Battery icons | boot sound/animation

##### Sounds come from the tablet device featured in the latest Zelda games, I have not even played them, just liked the sounds.
